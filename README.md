# Exam Project â€“ Rust Game Development

This repository contains our exam project built with Rust. We used **Bevy**, a game engine for Rust, as the foundation to develop our game.

As part of the project, we explored the integration of multiple features:
- **Database support**: Writing to PostgreSQL, Redis, and MongoDB.
- **AI integration**: Generating world lore and weapon ideas for players using AI.

Due to the limited timeframe for the exam, we weren't able to fully integrate all features into a single working project. Instead, we separated concerns into multiple repositories:

- **Database integration**: [Rust-Db-Connections](https://github.com/TofuBytes-Studies-Group/Rust-Db-Connections)
- **AI integration**: [Rust_price_prediction](https://github.com/TofuBytes-Studies-Group/Rust_price_prediction)

Thank you for checking out our work!
